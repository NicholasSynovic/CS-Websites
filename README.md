> A source of resources for getting started with Computer Science

## Hello World.

Welcome to BetterCS.

This is an attempt at creating a central source of information for getting started with Computer Science.

This project was truly meant as a way for myself and a few of my friends and colleagues to share CS related websites and other information. However, you should be able to also enjoy the content hosted here.

## Where To Start

Sites are catagorized by topic and can be viewed [here](topics.md).

## How To Contribute

If you would like to contribute, please [fork this project](https://github.com/NicholasSynovic/bettercs) and submit your pull requests!
